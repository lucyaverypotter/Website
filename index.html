		<h2>LET'S PUT THE KETTLE ON</h2>
		<P>Welcome weary traveller, you've found your way to my blog. I'm sure at this point in your day you are gasping for a cup of tea, so sit down and I shall put the kettle on. </p>
		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
		<p>I'm Lucy, by the way. At the point of writing this, a twenty-year-old girl in her second year of uni. I'm studying English Literature, of course. And at the end of it all I would love to be an author, but I am planning on becoming a teacher. There's a sense of life fulfilment that I just can't seem to find anywhere other than when I am teaching someone.</p>
		<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
		<p>I live by the sea, which is fantastic. Although that sea just happens to be in Wales so I can only swim in it about four times a year. But Wales is too beautiful to ever want to move elsewhere. </p>

		<p>You came here for the books? Oh, well, here's not a bad place for books. I've got hundreds, both written by others and ones I plan to write stored inside my head. Check out some of my reviews if you like. Or perhaps you're more of a DIY person, someone looking for help on how to make a book of your own. Well, I'll help you as much as I can. Though I've nothing published myself just yet, I'm afraid. I have done a lot of studying, there's a lot of education stored deep within this mind about how to write fiction and I don't mind sharing. </p>

		<p>I think the kettle's done. Feel free to look around whilst I make that tea. </p>
